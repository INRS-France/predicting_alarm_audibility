# features

This folder contains the *.h5* files representing the development and evaluation subsets of the dataset (mel-spectrograms and perceptual labels).

The content of this folder can be downloaded *via* this [link](https://zenodo.org/records/11353196/files/features.zip?download=1) and should be unzipped here.
Alternatively, it can also be extracted by running [extract_features.py](../prepare_data/extract_features.py) provided the [data/](../data) folder contains the required files.
